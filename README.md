# [Downloadify](https://downloadify.giuliopime.dev)
Downloadify is a website that can be used to download YouTube videos / playlists (with the option to download only audio) & Spotify songs / albums / playlists.  

### TODO (but I'm too lazy)
- Implement Redis for caching purposes
- Permit users to input more links at once and download them all together
- Make Spotify and YouTube downloads client-side 
- Polish APIs (and APIs request from the website) + documentation
- Use socket.io instead of submitting an http request every 3 seconds to check the status of the download
