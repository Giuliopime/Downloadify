# [Downloadify](https://downloadify.giuliopime.dev)
Downloadify is a website that can be used to download YouTube videos / playlists (with the option to download only audio) & Spotify songs / albums / playlists.  
It also has a desktop app, that I made as a school assignment in java Swing ^^.  
The backend instead has been made with express.js.

## Status
This doesn't work as I'm not using it anymore.

### TODO (but I'm too lazy)
- Implement Redis for caching purposes
- Permit users to input more links at once and download them all together
- Make Spotify and YouTube downloads client-side 
- Use socket.io instead of submitting an http request every 3 seconds to check the status of the download
