# [Downloadify](https://downloadify.giuliopime.dev)
Downloadify is a website that can be used to download YouTube videos / playlists (with the option to download only audio) & Spotify songs / albums / playlists.  

### TODO (but I'm too lazy)
- Implement Redis for caching purposes
- Make APIs usable without cookies (so accept headers for access tokens)
- Permit users to input more links at once and download them all together
- Make Spotify downloads client-side
